# Thesis / Capstone / Practice Projects / Legacy Projects / Case Studies
## Introduction
Most of the projects here was made during my college days. Many of them are incomplete or might throw an error.
## FAQ
### Why so many?
Well, I want to become the best programmer at that time so I did many practice/mock projects and some of them are paid by other students :D.
### Why push it on Github?
To show that I can do coding because no one believes. :(
